### Waterfall is a high-performance operating system based on CosmosOS, developed using C#. Designed for speed and efficiency, Waterfall OS leverages its own custom drivers to ensure optimal performance and compatibility. 


> [!note]
> This is not a beta or pre-release version of the full Waterfall OS.<br>
> This is just a cut out fragment of its installer (that's why it's called Core)
